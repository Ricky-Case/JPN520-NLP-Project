# Japanese Linguistics (LIN 520) - Final Project

## Project Outline:
- Independent research project in Japanese Linguistics.
- I have decided to combine my interests in video games and programming for this project, by writing this program to analyze the scripts of the video games in the Persona series.
    - Persona is developed by the video game company Atlus, based in Tokyo Japan.

## Notes:
- Using fugashi, a Cython wrapper for the Japanese tokenizer MeCab.
    - GIT: https://github.com/polm/fugashi

## MVP:
- Read in lines from the scripts for Persona 4 and Persona 5.
- Parse out individual words, and tokenize them.
- Tally the occurance of each token within each game's script.
- Writes data to csv files for comparison.
    - Words organized by parts of speech
    - Occurrence Comparison, based on Persona 4
    - Occurrence Comparison, based on Persona 5
    - Recurring phrases
