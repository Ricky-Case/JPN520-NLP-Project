# Japanese Linguistics (LIN 520) - Final Project

## Project Outline:
- Independent research project in Japanese Linguistics.
- I have decided to combine my interests in video games and programming for this project, by writing this program to analyze the scripts of the video games in the Persona series.
- - Persona is developed by the video game company Atlus, based in Tokyo Japan.
